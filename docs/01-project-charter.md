# Grateful Dead Concert Player - Project Charter

## Project Overview
A dedicated hardware device for streaming Grateful Dead concerts from the Internet Archive. Built on Raspberry Pi with touchscreen interface and high-quality audio output.

## Project Goals
1. Create a standalone device for accessing 15,000+ Grateful Dead shows
2. Learn Raspberry Pi development, Python programming, and hardware integration
3. Build something beautiful and functional for personal use
4. Document the process for potential future builders

## Learning Objectives
- Python programming (API integration, SQLite, audio playback)
- PyQt5 UI/UX design for touchscreen interfaces
- Raspberry Pi hardware setup and configuration
- Audio engineering (DAC integration, sound quality)
- 3D modeling and printing for custom enclosures
- Git/GitHub workflow and version control
- Software testing and debugging practices

## Development Approach
- **Step-by-step progression** through defined phases
- **Learning-focused**: Understand each component before moving forward
- **Iterative**: Build, test, refine, repeat
- **Documented**: Track decisions, learnings, and solutions
- **No rushing**: Quality and understanding over speed

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Device successfully streams and plays any GD show
- [ ] Intuitive interface usable without instructions
- [ ] Audio quality noticeably better than phone/laptop
- [ ] Reliable operation without crashes
- [ ] Understanding of all code and components
- [ ] Professionally finished physical build

## Timeline Philosophy
This is a learning journey, not a race. Each phase will be completed when:
1. The functionality works correctly
2. The code is understood and well-commented
3. Testing confirms reliability
4. Documentation is complete

Estimated total time: 3-6 months working casually
